HI!!! Here are the tasks that i carried out during my machine learning internship in codsoft


--TASK 1:  MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

In this task, I classified the movie genres using vectorizers, then used logistic regression to get the performance metrics and accuracy scores
and finally i plotted the barchart using matplot and seaborn modules.

--TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
-->I have used logistic regression and both decision tree as well as random forest classifier for classification
the accuracy i have obtained for the algorithms are:
*random forest=99.52
*decision tree=99.60
*logistic regression=99.41
in which the classifier which showed highest accuracy was DECISION TREE
