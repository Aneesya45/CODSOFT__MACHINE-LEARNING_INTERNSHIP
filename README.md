HI!!! Here are the tasks that i carried out during my machine learning internship at codsoft


--TASK 1:  MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

In this task, I classified the movie genres using vectorizers, then used logistic regression to get the performance metrics and accuracy scores
and finally i plotted the barchart using matplot and seaborn modules.

--TASK 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

-->The task is to detect whether the transaction is being made by a person who do not own the credit card

-->I have used logistic regression and both decision tree as well as random forest classifier for classification
the accuracy i have obtained for the algorithms are:
*random forest=99.52
*decision tree=99.60
*logistic regression=99.41
in which the classifier which showed highest accuracy was DECISION TREE

--TASK 3: BANK CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

-->The task here is to predict the number of customers who may churn or leave the bank with various factors such as geography,gender,credit card points,
salary,activeness etc.,.
-->for this, I used random forest classifier and logistic regression.

--TASK 4: SPAM MESSAGE DETECTION

-->The task here is to detect whether the message is spam or ham.
-->Here,I used transformers,tensor flow and keras modules for the detection process.

--TASK 5: HAND-WRITTEN TEXT RECOGNITION

-->Here, the task is to detect whether the text is hand-written or digital.
-->So for this, I used
